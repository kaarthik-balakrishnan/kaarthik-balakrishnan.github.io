Some of the things I've worked on:

### Crumbs
A research co-pilot to map scientific knowledge, surface gaps, and help scientists ask better questions.

### Neuro/BCI tools
Pipelines and analysis tools for neural and EEG/BCI data.

### Biophysics & blood storage
Experimental and computational work on heme-binding proteins and stored blood quality.

(More detail and links coming soon.)
