### Behavioral and circuit principles of temperature gradient navigation

**Keywords:** thermoregulation, zebrafish, Markov models, large-scale behavior, 2P imaging  

- Designed new **hardware and behavioral paradigms** to study how larval zebrafish navigate realistic temperature gradients, increasing experiment throughput by ~50%.  
- Built scalable **Python analysis pipelines** to extract posture, bouts, and trajectories from long behavioral recordings across many thermal environments.  
- Used **statistical and Markov models** to show how navigation strategies change across temperature and timescale, and linked these behaviors to distinct neural cell types with two-photon calcium imaging.  
- Culminated in a first-author paper in *Current Biology* on the behavioral and circuit principles underlying thermal navigation. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### Model discovery to link neural activity and behavior

**Keywords:** explainable ML, representation learning, neural decoding, eLife 2023  

- Co-developed a **general ML framework** to discover low-dimensional task variables and latent states that explain both neural activity and behavior.  
- Demonstrated ~**40% improvement in predictive accuracy** over standard methods while retaining interpretability of the discovered variables.  
- Shared first-author credit on an *eLife* publication and presented the work at SfN and NIH BRAIN Initiative meetings. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

### Thermoregulation hardware & experimental design

**Keywords:** instrumentation, data throughput, experiment design  

- Designed and implemented **custom thermal control hardware** and acquisition routines to deliver naturalistic temperature profiles to freely swimming zebrafish.  
- Integrated behavior tracking, stimulus control, and logging into a cohesive pipeline, making it easy for others in the lab to run complex experiments with minimal overhead.

### Complex systems & intelligence (ongoing)

**Keywords:** complex systems, neural manifolds, interpretability  

- Motivated by a background in **statistical mechanics and complex systems**, I am interested in applying manifold learning, causal inference, and feature visualization tools to both **biological and artificial networks**.  
- Current explorations involve using geometric and dynamical-systems viewpoints to make high-dimensional neural representations more interpretable and controllable. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
