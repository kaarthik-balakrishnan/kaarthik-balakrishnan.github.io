I'm **Kaarthik Abhinav Balakrishnan**, a computational neuroscientist and PhD candidate in Biophysics at The Ohio State University.

My path started in **fundamental physics** – quantum mechanics, field theory, and general relativity – driven by the belief that understanding basic laws would explain everything else. Over time, ideas from **statistical mechanics and complex systems** (especially Philip Anderson’s *More is Different*) convinced me that the most interesting phenomena don’t live in the equations themselves, but in the **emergent behavior of many interacting units**.

That perspective naturally pulled me toward the **brain**: a physical system where emergent computation is the whole point. During my BS-MS in Physics at IISER Pune and my PhD at OSU, I built that bridge from theory to data, moving into **neuroscience, machine learning, and large-scale behavioral analysis**.

In my graduate work, I:

- Designed **hardware and experimental paradigms** to study thermoregulation in larval zebrafish, increasing experimental throughput by ~50%.
- Built **Python pipelines** to quantify navigation in realistic temperature gradients, discovering distinct neural cell types encoding sensory features and developing **Markov models** that capture long-timescale stochastic behavior.
- Co-developed a **machine-learning framework** that links neural activity to stimuli and behavior, improving predictive accuracy by ~40% over existing approaches and making model structure more interpretable.

Long term, I want to **build neurotechnology and interpretable AI systems**: tools that read, understand, and interface with brain activity, and frameworks that make complex neural and artificial networks less opaque and more controllable.

Outside the lab, I like thinking about **intelligence as a physical process**, tinkering with side projects in neurotech and AI, and occasionally over-analyzing Beatles songs.
