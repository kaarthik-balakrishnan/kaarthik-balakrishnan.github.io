<p>I'm <strong>Kaarthik Abhinav Balakrishnan</strong>, a computational neuroscientist and PhD candidate in Biophysics at The Ohio State University.</p>

<p>My path started in <strong>fundamental physics</strong> — quantum mechanics, field theory, and general relativity — driven by the belief that understanding basic laws would explain everything else. Over time, ideas from <strong>statistical mechanics and complex systems</strong> (especially Philip Anderson’s <em>More is Different</em>) convinced me that the most interesting phenomena don’t live in the equations themselves, but in the <strong>emergent behavior of many interacting units</strong>.</p>

<p>That perspective naturally pulled me toward the <strong>brain</strong>: a physical system where emergent computation is the whole point. During my BS–MS in Physics at IISER Pune and my PhD at OSU, I built that bridge from theory to data, moving into <strong>neuroscience, machine learning, and large-scale behavioral analysis</strong>.</p>

<p>In my graduate work, I:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Designed <strong>hardware and experimental paradigms</strong> to study thermoregulation in larval zebrafish, increasing experimental throughput by ~50%.</li>
	<li>Built <strong>Python pipelines</strong> to quantify navigation in realistic temperature gradients, discovering distinct neural cell types encoding sensory features and developing <strong>Markov models</strong> that capture long-timescale stochastic behavior.</li>
	<li>Co-developed a <strong>machine-learning framework</strong> that links neural activity to stimuli and behavior, improving predictive accuracy by ~40% over existing approaches and making model structure more interpretable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Long term, I want to <strong>build neurotechnology and interpretable AI systems</strong>: tools that read, understand, and interface with brain activity, and frameworks that make complex neural and artificial networks less opaque and more controllable.</p>

<p>Outside the lab, I like thinking about <strong>intelligence as a physical process</strong>, tinkering with side projects in neurotech and AI, and occasionally over-analyzing Beatles songs.</p>
