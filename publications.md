### Journal Articles

<a id="thermo-2025"></a>
**Behavioral and circuit principles of temperature gradient navigation** (2025)  
*Kaarthik A. Balakrishnan, Martin Haesemeyer*  
_Current Biology_ (in press). Preprint: bioRxiv 2025.03.17.643749.  
A combined behavioral and imaging study that uncovers how larval zebrafish integrate thermal information over long timescales to navigate gradients, identifying distinct neural cell types and circuit motifs that support thermoregulatory behavior.

<a id="model-discovery-2023"></a>
**Model discovery to link neural activity to behavioral tasks** (2023)  
*Jamie Costabile\*, Kaarthik A. Balakrishnan\*, Sina Schwinn, Martin Haesemeyer* (\*equal contribution)  
_eLife_ 12:e83289.  
Introduces an explainable ML framework that discovers latent variables explaining both neural activity and behavior, achieving substantial gains in predictive performance while retaining interpretability.
