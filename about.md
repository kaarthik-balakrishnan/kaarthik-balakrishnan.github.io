## Timeline

Below is a timeline scaffold — I'll pull exact dates and additional items from your resume if you want me to place them precisely.

- **PhD Candidate, Biophysics**, The Ohio State University — (dates: add from resume)
- **BS–MS, Physics**, IISER Pune — (dates: add from resume)
- Additional education, fellowships, or positions — (add items from resume)

You can place a PDF copy of your resume in `assets/` (for example `assets/KaarthikBalakrishnan_Resume_October2025.pdf`) and I can automatically extract and populate the timeline if you want. For now this scaffold keeps the `about` page focused on a chronological timeline rather than the full bio.
